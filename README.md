This is a Responsive Netflix Landing Page that I designed and developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
The main focus of this project was to practice frontend development, layout designing, and making a webpage responsive across all devices.

Features:
1. Responsive UI: Designed to adjust smoothly across smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

2. Bootstrap Framework: Utilized Bootstrap components and grid system to streamline the responsive design.

3. Clean Layout: Styled with HTML and custom CSS for a modern, Netflix-like appearance.

4. Static page: Purely a frontend UI with no backend functionality.

Tech Stack:
1. HTML5

2. CSS3

3. Bootstrap 4/5
